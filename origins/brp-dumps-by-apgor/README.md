Note: dumps were obtained by reading sequential chunks of the BRP data one by one into Elektronika MK-52 calculator RAM and then manually taking the program codes from the calculator display.

Use Python 3 (tested on 3.9.4) to run convert.py script that generates normalized hexadecimal dumps from those originally obtained by apgor.
